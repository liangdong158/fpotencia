     * This class implemets the Z-Matrix block susbtitution
     * this method is very simulat to the gauss seidel method but
     * using the impedance matrix instead of the admittance matrix.
     *
     * The number of iterations can be compared to Newton Raphson, while the
     * computation per iteration is really low in comparison.
     * Due to the use of the Z matrix which is full unlike the Y matrix,
     * this method enhances the convergence.
     *
     * On the other hand the Z-matrix is obtained as the inverse of the Y matrix,
     * but this is only done once, so if many power flow simulations are expected,
     * the calculation of Z will not vary if the circuit topology remains.
